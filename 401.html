<h1>401 Section 4 Experimental Methods Spring 2018</h1>
Class: Monday, Wednesday 10:10 to 11:00 Rackley 104<br>
<br>
Lab: Friday 10:10 to 11:00 Keller 210<br>
We will use Python instead of R.<br>
Use jupyter, for example in <a href="https://atom.io/">atom editor</a> install <a href="https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen">hydrogen</a>.<br>
There are other useful packages for Python on atom, please google and choose as you like.<br>
There are also minor setup details, please google.<br>
Alternatively install <a href="https://www.yhat.com/products/rodeo">rodeo</a> on your laptop.<br>
Please see <a href="http://rodeo.yhat.com/docs/#installing-rodeo">here</a>.<br>
Alternatively just use <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">pythonanywhere</a>.<br>
In labs I will use <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">kaggle</a>.<br>
This would be the best option if you do not have a laptop</a>.<br>
For R, use <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">rstudio</a>.<br>
If you have issues, ask peers, then come to instructer or TA.<br>
The hw policy listed below applies to lab assignments as well.<br>
