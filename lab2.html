Q1<br>
Consider X~Bin(100,0.01).<br>
Report P(X=7), P(X=8), P (X=9), try to use ONLY ONE line of command to return all these three values.<br>
Use two different ways to find the probability $P(0\le X<5)$, be careful when treating “end points” 0 and 5.<br>
For the parameters, n=100, p=0.01, np=1. It seems to satisfy the condition that the pmf of X can be approximated by a Poisson random variable Y with λ = np. Compute P (X = i), P (Y = i), i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively and see whether the Poisson approximation performs well (You may use the method in
part 1 to store the result in one vector for each of X and Y ).<br>
<br>
Q2<br>
Work through code on finding QQ-plot of a sequence of numbers shown on kaggle (no need to submit).<br>
Generate 10000 random numbers from N(50,4), store them as a vector. It is expected that the sample mean of this vector should be close to the population mean 50. Verify this.<br>
Suppose X~NB(3,0.8). More specificly, let X be the total numbers needed to achieve 3rd success in a sequence of independent repeated Bernoulli trials with success probability 0.8. Report the probability that P (5 < X ≤ 10).<br>
<br>
Q3<br>
Simulate random samples from the following distributions:<br>
Bernoulli(0.5) (so that μ = 0.5 and $\sigma^2$ = 0.25). (Hint: You can use rbinom to
generate Bernoulli random numbers.)<br>
Uniform(0, 1) (so that μ = 0.5 and $\sigma^2$ = 1/12).<br>
Possion(1) (so that μ = 1 and $\sigma^2$ = 1).<br>
For each case, set the number of simulations N to be 1000 and for each simulation, generate n = 2000 random numbers. Report 3 pieces of code, 3 Q-Q plots and your
conclusion. You only need to slightly modify the demo code to get the right answer.<br>
