<h1>Some details in programming</h1>
Flatten in numpy will take each row of the matrix and stack.<br>
The vec operator in mathematics will take each column and stack.<br>
The eig function in linalg will return the eigenvectors in the columns.<br>
<br>
Julia<br>
repmat takes a matrix and repeats it vertically by the first argument,<br>
repeats it horizantally by the second argument.<br>
If you had fed a vector it will be treated as a $n$ by 1 matrix.<br>
mean with argument 1 takes the column wise mean.<br>
mean with argument 2 takes the row wise mean.<br>
I guess the number signifies along which dimension the mean is taken.<br>
Similarly, sum with argument 1 takes the column wise mean.<br>
sum with argument 2 takes the row wise mean.<br>
elementwise division of an $n$ by $m$ matrix by a $1$ by $m$ matrix,<br>
i.e., a transposed vector, returned element wise division of each row<br>
by the 1 by $m$ matrix.<br>
reshape also conforms with the vec operation in mathematics.<br>
If one is deforming a vector into a matrix ($m$ by $n$),<br>
we take consecutive $m$ elements and place them as columns from left to right.<br>
If one is deforming a matrix into a 1 by $m\cdot n$ transposed vector,<br>
the columns of the matrix are taken, transposed, and laid from left to right.<br>
If one is deforming a matrix into a $m\cdot n$ by 1 vector,<br>
the columns of the matrix are taken, and laid from top to bottom.<br>
