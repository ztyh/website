Q1<br>
Try to calculate pearson correlation and spearman rank correlation between different stocks. Try to find a pair that has high correlation and a pair that has low correlation. Make a new vector where the value is the equally weighted sum of the two stocks. What do you notice about the variance? Try to use a common stock in each pair. The variance of the former would most likely be larger than the variance of the latter but this is not guaranteed.<br>
<br>
Q2<br>
A linear regression can be fit by $(X^t X)^{-1} X^t Y$.<br>
Here $Y$ is the response stacked in a tall vector ($n$ by 1).<br>
$X$ is the predictors laid flat with 1 in the beginning and stacked $n$ times for the number of samples we have ($n$ by $d+1$).<br>
So the dimensions of this multiplication is $[(d+1\ \text{by}\ n)]\times(n\ \text{by}\ d+1)]^{-1}\times(d+1\ \text{by}\ n)\times (n\ \text{by}\ 1)=(d+1\ \text{by}\ d+1)\times (d+1\ \text{by}\ 1)=(d+1\ \text{by}\ 1)$. For a data of your choice in kaggle, obtain the estimate of the coefficients by constructing the above matrix calculation.<br>
